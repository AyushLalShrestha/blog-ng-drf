TODOS for the app in next step:

1. Create an update api endpoint in the backend so that PUT method will be supported to edit 
    blogs, current user details etc
  - Implement it in the UI as well

2. Blog details should be more viewable

3. Implement adding images in a blog
 - images must dynamically and effectively load in the UI as well
